NOTES: This is a command-line tool built for windows OS, 
when you crawl a website it returns the results in your command line.
This tool was inspired by the fact that there are not that many command-line 
tools for windows in comparison to linux. 
- Also I was rather tired of trying to find a tool to download that tells me I need to
download other dependencies for it too run. I do not want to clutter my OS with a bunch of
code I didnt read i dont know about you... So yeah web scraper, pure python, one of a kind.
